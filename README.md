# Code for reading a IAQ core-c interal air quality sensor and sending the CO2 and TVOC values to home assistant via MQTT

This code is meant to be used to read a IAQ core-c sensor with a ESP8266.

The code makes use of the brzo library: https://github.com/pasko-zh/brzo_i2c (included in this repository)

To use the code, make sure you fill in your wifi details and Home assistant details.

# IAQ core C / mqtt sample

Code for reading a IAQ core-c interal air quality sensor and sending the CO2 and TVOC values via MQTT. I used this code to send the values to home assistant, but you can use it for pretty much any application that accepts MQTT messages.
